Read the PIMF Starter book almost anywhere. Available as a PDF, EPUB, and MOBI. You can now read it on all devices, as well as offline: http://book.pimf-framework.de

PIMF Philosophy
---------------
Good, robust business logic is better than a fat, complex framework. Most of the PHP frameworks are bigger than your problem. At most, you need less than 20% of the framework’s functionality to solve your problem. Therefore, we believe that the “right” 20% of the effort is the 80% of the results - and that is PIMF.

The aim was to create robust and secure projects and deliver them fast. We wanted just one easy framework that can be used for all our projects. And then - PIMF was born!

PIMF’s implementation is based on well-proven design patterns as well as fast object-relational mapping mechanisms - like famous PHP frameworks had. The architecture is designed to be upgrade friendly - so you can upgrade to newer versions without having to overwrite your projects. And for all of you out there who like to create rich application interfaces - we have created mechanisms to couple your GUI to the controllers in an easy and fast way.

Framework Sponsor
