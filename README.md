**Note:** This repository contains the core code of the PIMF framework. If you want to build an application using PIMF, please use one of the quick starting bundles below.

PIMF Philosophy
---------------
A good and robust business-logic is better that a fat and complex framework. Most of the PHP frameworks are bigger than your problem. At all you need less than 20% of the framework’s functionality to solve you problem. Therefore we believe that the “right” 20% of the effort is the 80% of the results - and that is PIMF.

The aim was to create robust and secure projects and deliver them fast. We wanted just one easy framework, that can be used once for all our projects. And then - PIMF was born!

PIMF’s implementation is based on well proved design patterns as well as fast objects relation mapping mechanisms - like famous PHP frameworks had. The architecture is designed upgrade friendly - so you can upgrade to newer versions without having to override your projects. And for all of you out there, who like to create rich application interfaces with ExtJs or Dojo - we have created mechanisms to couple your GUI to the controllers in an easy and fast way.
