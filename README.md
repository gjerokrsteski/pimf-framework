PIMF Philosophy
---------------
Most PHP frameworks are bigger than the problem you are trying to solve. A big and complex framework can't protect you from poor business logic, and will often become a large part of your problem. Often you need 20% or less from the functionality of a full-stack framework to solve your problem. Therefore finding the right 20% of the framework functionality solves the remaining 80% of your problem. PIMF is an opinionated framework which follows common best practises that strives to be those right 20%.

PIMF was first created for our own personal use. The aim was to deliver robust and secure projects fast. We just wanted one easy framework, which could be used for all of our projects. And then - PIMF was born!

PIMFâ€™s implementation is based on well proven design patterns as well as fast object relation mapping mechanisms. PIMF is designed to be upgrade friendly - so that you can upgrade to newer versions with minimal effort.

Framework Sponsor
