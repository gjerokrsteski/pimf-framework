# Error handling & customizing 404 500 pages

All of the configuration options regarding errors and logging live in the **[config.app.php](https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-blog/blob/master/app/config.app.php)** file.

```php
  /*
  |------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Settings for the error handling behavior
  |------------------------------------------------------------------------
  */
  'error' => array(
    'ignore_levels' => array(E_USER_DEPRECATED),
    'debug_info' => true,
  	'log' => true,
  ),
```

The 'ignore_levels' option contains an array of error levels that should be ignored by PIMF. By "ignored", we mean that we won't stop execution
of the script on these errors. However, they will be logged when logging is enabled.

The 'debug_info' option indicates if the framework should display the error message and stack trace when an error occurs. For development, you
will want this to be 'true'. In a production environment, set this to 'false'. When 'debug_info' is disabled, the view located in 'core/Pimf/_error/500.php' will be displayed, which contains a generic error message.

If a request enters your application but does not match any existing route, the 404 page will be raised.

To enable logging, set the 'log' option in the error configuration to 'true'. When enabled, the Closure defined by the logger configuration
item will be executed when an error occurs. This gives you total flexibility in how the error should be logged.

### Custom 404 and 500 pages
If you want to customize the the 404 or 500 view, just override it by creating a clone of it at you application like 'app/MyFirstBlog/_error/500.php'.
