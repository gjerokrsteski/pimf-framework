A thin PHP framework with fewer implementation rules that is easy to learn to use? PIMF is about to satisfy your demands!\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\nThis repository contains the core code of the PIMF framework. If you want to build an application using PIMF, please use one of the quick-start bundles below.\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Blog bundle using SQLite\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThis Blog is a run-ready bundle which uses PIMF framework and includes a blog application based on the SQLite database. Here you can learn how to work with \\Pimf\\EntityManager, \\Pimf\\Util\\Validator and \\Pimf\\View. https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-blog\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Blog bundle using MySQL and SQLite\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis Blog is a run-ready bundle which uses PIMF framework and includes a blog application based on the MySQL database. Sessions will be stored in a SQLite database.\r\nHere you can learn how to work with Pimf\\EntityManager, Pimf\\Util\\Validator and Pimf\\View. https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-blog-mysql\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Vanilla bundle\r\n------------------------------\r\nThis is a run-ready \"Hello world\" bundle using PIMF micro-framework. Here you can learn how to work with \\Pimf\\View and \\Pimf\\Router. https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-vanilla\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Haanga bundle\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThis is a run-ready \"Hello world\" application using PIMF micro-framework and Haanga (http://haanga.org/documentation) - a fast and secure template engine for PHP that uses Django syntax.\r\nHere you can learn how to work with \\Pimf\\View\\Haanga template engine and \\Pimf\\Router. https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-haanga\r\n\r\nQuickstart with PIMF-Twig bundle\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThis is a run-ready \"Hello world\" application using PIMF micro-framework and Twig - a flexible, fast, and secure template\r\nengine for PHP (http://twig.sensiolabs.org) brought to us by the Symfony framework developers. Here you can learn how to work\r\nwith \\Pimf\\View\\Twig template engine and \\Pimf\\Router. https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf-twig\r\n\r\nLearning PIMF\r\n-------------\r\nOne of the best ways to learn PIMF is to read through the entirety of its documentation. This guide details all aspects of the framework and how to apply them to your application. http://docs.pimf-framework.de\r\n\r\nRead the PIMF Starter book almost anywhere. Available as a PDF, EPUB, and MOBI. You can now read it on all devices, as well as offline: http://book.pimf-framework.de\r\n\r\nPIMF Philosophy\r\n---------------\r\nGood, robust business logic is better than a fat, complex framework. Most of the PHP frameworks are bigger than your problem. At most, you need less than 20% of the framework’s functionality to solve your problem. Therefore, we believe that the “right” 20% of the effort is the 80% of the results - and that is PIMF.\r\n\r\nThe aim was to create robust and secure projects and deliver them fast. We wanted just one easy framework that can be used for all our projects. And then - PIMF was born!\r\n\r\nPIMF’s implementation is based on well-proven design patterns as well as fast object-relational mapping mechanisms - like famous PHP frameworks had. The architecture is designed to be upgrade friendly - so you can upgrade to newer versions without having to overwrite your projects. And for all of you out there who like to create rich application interfaces - we have created mechanisms to couple your GUI to the controllers in an easy and fast way.\r\n\r\nFramework Sponsor\r\n-------------------\r\nJetBRAINS supports the development of PIMF with PHPStorm licenses and we feel confident that PHPStorm strongly reinforces PIMF's quality.
